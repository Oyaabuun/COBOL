# COBOL
COBOL a still relevant but less known language. COBOL which runs 70% of financial institutions has made me crazy. When i started learning this all you get videos and content but where to practice it..  Now i will help you where to do it , Setup of opencobol and running it is not a real practice. Doing it on a z/OS is actual deal with JCL. 
In Today's guide i will help you with all tha resources you can follow to setup the practice environemnt. 
Soon i will make a opensource cobol course on youtube and teach it for free 
There are people who are charging money also for this setup but guys after seeing opensource community for all these languages i believe this guide will help you learn this a lot 
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
So Entreprise COBOL V6.4 which is currently the latest at the time of me writing this guide.
I have done all the setup necessary for running a IBM z/OS V3.1 sep 2023 release on a host windows machine with windows 11 

There are few thing you need to keep in mind when doing it

** THIS GUIDE IS ENTIRELY FOR LEARNING PURPOSE 

** THIS GUIDE DOESNT SUPPORT ANY KIND of PIRACY OF IBM z/OS 3.1 

** THIS GUIDE is only meant to help people out there who want to learn how these BIG IRONs operate or are already working in the industry and looking to upgrade their skills 

** COBOL developers numbers are decreasing day by day and the world needs more COBOL developers becasue many many many big organissation daily mission critical workloads are still on these systems

** I donot personally support any migration of COBOL, This language is very close to assembly language and the beauty of this thing is it can process millions and billions of records really fast .

** There is a reason why big businesses still are dependent on it.  COBOL Bro is reliable , resilient and COBOL is the fastest way to process data 

** Next time you do a ATM transaction or online transaction through you credit card or netbanking (SAY ALL HAIL BOSS COBOL for my sweet purchase. )
